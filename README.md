# üç¥foodsharing app

This is a Proof of Concept to show how [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) could rock the [foodsharing](https://foodsharing.de) world :smile:

This thingy runs on iOS and Android - one code, one love!


## üéâ What's implemented?

* Login form (with links to register / forgot)
* Full i18n support (so far: English included)
* Fastlane (icon & badge generation, certificates, deploy, ...)
* Custom fonts

## ToDo

* Login / Logout
* Storing session cookie
