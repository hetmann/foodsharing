In this way, those responsible can take care of problem cases in good time and exclude people from the platform if they behave inappropriately several times. Please describe the incident in at least 120 characters so that those responsible or the mediation team can take appropriate care of the case. Mention the frequency of the incident, place, time and any other food savers present!"
